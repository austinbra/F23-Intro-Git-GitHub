# Fall 2023 Git & GitHub Workshop

It's time to practice your Git & GitHub skills with an exercise! Once you've filled out the [form to get added as a collaborator](https://tx.ag/f23gitgithub), pull the content, and add a text file with your name to the `people` directory. In the file, type your year, major, and what you're most looking forward to in ACC this semester. Once you're done, push your changes and open a pull request. **Make sure to work on your own branch!**

All pull requests need a reviewer in this repo -- make sure to add Jad (Video-Lab) as a reviewer.

An example is given in `people/jad_khalili.txt`.

You can view the slides [here.](https://tx.ag/fall23gitslides)

Good luck!
